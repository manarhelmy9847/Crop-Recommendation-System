# Crop-Recommendation-System
 This project uses machine learning to recommend the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental conditions such as soil nutrients and climate factors. By analyzing real-time input data (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall), the system predicts the best crop for optimal yield.
