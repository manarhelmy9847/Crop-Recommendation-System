# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

This project uses machine learning to recommend the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and climate conditions. It helps farmers make data-driven decisions by analyzing features like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## 🧠 Overview

The goal of this project is to classify crop types and suggest the most appropriate crop to cultivate, using a machine learning classifier trained on agricultural data.

The model takes in various features such as:
- Soil Nutrients: `N`, `P`, `K`
- Environmental Factors: `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `pH`, `Rainfall`
